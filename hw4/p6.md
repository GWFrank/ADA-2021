## 1

A graph $G(V,E)$ contains an Eulerian cycle if and only if $deg(v)$ is even $\forall\ v\in V$.

## 2.

Consider an undirected graph $G$ with 0 edge at start. Because all vertices has degree 0 (even), $|V'| = 0$.

For each edge added, only degrees of the two vertices on this edge change, and there are three cases:

- Case 1: Both vertices were with even degree.

  Since they both change from even to odd, $|V'|$ is increased by 2.

- Case 2: Both vertices were with odd degree.

  Since they both change from odd to even, $|V'|$ is decreased by 2.

- Case 3: One vertex has odd degree and the other has even.

  Since one will change from odd to even, and the other will change from even to odd, $|V'|$ remains the same.

In all three cases, the parity of $|V'|$ always remains the same, which is even. Since a tree is an undirected graph, $|V'|$ is also even.

## 3.

Suppose $cost(M) \gt OPT/2$.

Let $C$ be a cycle that yields $OPT$, and $C$ contains edges $c_1 , c_2 , \cdots , c_{|V'|}$.

Both $C_\text{odd}=\{c_{2k-1} | 0 \lt k \le \frac{|V'|}{2}\}$ and $C_\text{even}=\{c_{2k} | 0 \lt k \le \frac{|V'|}{2}\}$ are perfect matchings. And because $cost(C_\text{odd})+cost(C_\text{even})=OPT$, $\min\{C_\text{odd},C_\text{even}\} \le OPT/2 \lt cost(M)$ .

By choosing the one with smaller cost, we have a cost lower than $cost(M)$. $M$ doesn't have the minimum cost, which contradicts with the fact that $M$ is optimal.

Therefore $cost(M)$ must be less than or equal to $OPT/2$.
