# ADA - Divide & Conquer

What is D & C ?

- Solve the problem **recursively**

- Apply three steps:
  
  1. **Divide**: Divide the problem into several subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
  2. **Conquer**: Conquer subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem is small enough (aka base case) then just solve it.
  3. **Combine**: Combine solutions of subproblems to get the desired solution.
