### Algorithm

1. Sort $P_i$ from large to small.
2. Concatenate $P_i$ in this sorted order, first element in the leftest place.

### Proof

Suppose $M$ is an optimal solution, $M_x$ is the $x$-th digit (from left to right).

If $\exist\ i,j$ such that $i<j$ and $M_i < M_j$, because $P_i$ is exactly one digit long, we can swap $M_i,M_j$ and get $M'$. Since $M'_i=M_j>M_i$ and $M'_x=M_x \ \forall\ 1\le x\lt i$, $M'>M$. This contradicts with the assumption that $M$ is an optimal solution, therefore $\forall\ i<j,\ M_i\ge M_j$.

### Time Complexity

Time complexity of each step:

1. Sort in $O(n\log{n})$.
2. Concatenate in $O(n)$.

Total time complexity $O(n\log{n})+O(n)=O(n\log{n})$.

## (3)

### Algorithm

1. Sort $P_i$ by:
   1. Compare their first (leftest) digit, the larger one goes first.
   2. If the same, compare their next digit. If there are no second digit, compare as if it's the same as first digit. The larger one does first.
   3. If they are still not seperated, repeat previous step until all digits are compared.
   4. If all digits are compared, their order will remain the same.
2. Concatenate $P_i$ in this sorted order, first element in the leftest place.

### Time Complexity

Time complexity of each step:

1. The compare function runs in $O(1)$ time (because $P_i$ is capped at $1000$), therefore the sort runs in $O(n\log{n}) \cdot O(1)=O(n\log{n})$ time.
2. Concatenating runs in $O(n)$ time.

Total time complexity $O(n\log{n})+O(n)=O(n\log{n})$.

### Algorithm

1. Let $m=0$.
2. Loop through $P_i$ to record how many times each digit has appeared as $a_{\text{digit}}$. Also let $b=a_1+a_4+a_7,c=a_2+a_5+a_8$.
3. Loop $d$ from $9$ to $0$
   - If $d \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, concatenate $a_d$ digits of $d$ to back of $m$.
   - If $d \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
      - If $a_d \le b$, concatenate $a_d$ digits of $d$ to back of $m$, and decrease $b$ by $a_d$.
      - Else, concatenate $b$ digits of $d$ to back of $m$, and let $b=0$.
   - If $d \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$
      - If $a_d \le c$, concatenate $a_d$ digits of $d$ to back of $m$, and decrease $c$ by $a_d$.
      - Else, concatenate $c$ digits of $d$ to back of $m$, and let $c=0$.
4. $m$ is the maximum satisfying number under assumption 1 & 3.

### Time Complexity

Time complexity of each step:

1. $O(1)$
2. $O(N)$
3. $O(\sum{a_d})=O(N)$
   - All cases are $O(a_d)$.

Total time complexity is $O(1)+O(N)+O(N)=O(N)$.
