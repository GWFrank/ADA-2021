### Algorithm

Run Prim's algorithm but with some modification:

- Choose the edge with highest weight that connects to a vertex not in the tree yet.

- Initial value of $v.key$ is $-\infty$.

- Update $v.key$ when there is an edge to $v$ with higher weight.

### Time complexity

With priority queue implemented with binary max-heap:

- Building heap takes $O(V)$ time.

- Extracting max takes $O(\log{V})$ time, and this is called $V$ times.

- Modifying key takes $O(\log{V})$ time, and this is called $O(E)$ times.

Total time complexity is $O(V) + V \cdot O(\log{V}) + O(E) \cdot O(\log{V})=O((V+E)\log{V})$. And because $G$ is connected, $V=O(E)$, $O((V+E)\log{V})=O(E\log{V})$.

### Correctness

> Cut property:
> 
> For any partition that separates vertices into two sets (a "cut" $C$), let $e$ be the edge with highest weight that connects these two sets. The maximum spanning tree contains $e$.

> Proof:

> Suppose $e$ isn't in the maximum spanning tree. First add $e$ into the tree, and there should be cycle.

> Therefore $e$ is the maximum spanning tree

Consider vertices in the current tree and vertices not in to be two sets. The algorithm always adds the highest-weight edge, and by cut property this edge must be in the maximum spanning tree.

And because the algorithm gives a spanning tree, it must be the maximum spanning tree.

## (2)

Consider the width of each road to be the weight of that edge. For edges with the same weight, we define their order by order of the smaller vertex first, then the larger vertex.

Suppose that there are multiple paths between $s$ and $t$.

For any two paths $(p_1,p_2)$, they should together form a cycle in $G$. WLOG, assume that $w(p_1)=w_1 < w(p_2)=w_2$, and the minimum edge in this cycle is $e$ with $w(e)=w_1$.

Suppose $e$ is in the maximum spanning tree $T$, removing $e$ should separate the tree into two components. And there should be another edge $e'$ in the cycle that isn't in the tree now, and can connect these two components. By adding $e'$, we have a new spanning tree with larger weight, therefore $e$ must not be in the maximum spanning tree.

By this fact, only the widest path between $s$ and $t$ is still in $T$. Therefore $T$ qualifies to be $G'$, and edges in $T$ can be $E'$.
