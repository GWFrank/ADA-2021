### Algorithm

$$
S(r,T)=\text{deg}(r)\text{ in $E_T$}
$$

### Time Complexity

Finding $\text{deg}(v)$ with adjacency list for any vertex $v$ uses $O(1)$ time.

### Correctness

Suppose that edge $(r,v)$ is a tree edge. During `DFS-VISIT(v)` all vertices connected to $v$ without using edge $(r,v)$ are found, and these vertices forms a connected component after the removal of $r$. Therefore the number of connected components after removing $r$ is the degree of $r$ in $E_T$.
