### Algorithm

$$
s(r,T)=\text{deg}(r)\text{ in $E_T$}
$$

### Time Complexity

Finding $\text{deg}(v)$ with adjacency list for any vertex $v$ uses $O(1)$ time.

### Correctness

For any vertex $v$ such that edge $(r,v)\in E_T$, the sub-tree with root at $v$ is a connected component after the removal of $r$. And since $T$ is a tree, each of these sub-trees isn't connected to each other without $r$. Therefore the number of connected components after removing $r$ is the degree of $r$ in $E_T$.

## (2)

### Algorithm

$$
s(v,G) = 2
$$

### Time Complexity

Since it's always 2, it takes $O(1)$ time.

### Correctness

Because there are no edges from descendants of $v$ to ancestor of $v$, and $G$ is undirected, all edges between descendants of $v$ are tree edges, and they form a connected component after removing $v$. All the other vertices are connected to $r$, and they form the second connected component after removing $v$.

## (3)

### Algorithm

$$
s(v,G) = |\{\text{up}_T(w_t)
\mid \text{up}_T(w_t) = \text{depth}(v) \text{ and } 1\le t \le k \}| + 1
$$

### Correctness

Because $G$ is undirected, every edge is either a tree edge or a back edge. This means the vertex that $\text{up}_T(w_k)$ implies is either $v$ or an ancestor of $v$.

If this vertex is $v$, $\text{up}_T(w_k)=\text{depth(v)}$, and after removing $v$, $w_k$ and its descendants forms a connected component themselves.

If this vertex is an ancestor of $v$, $\text{up}_T(w_k)<\text{depth(v)}$, and after removing $v$, $w_k$ and its descendants joins the connected component of ancestors of $v$.

Therefore $s(v,G)$ is the number of $w_k$ such that $\text{up}_T(w_k)=\text{depth(v)}$ plus the connected component of ancestors of v.

## (4)

### Algorithm

1. Choose any vertex as root $r$. Run DFS from $r$.
   
   1. During DFS, maintain the depth of each vertices in the DFS tree with: $v.\text{depth}=v.\pi.\text{depth} + 1$
   
   2. After visiting every neighboring vertices of $v$, calculate $\text{up}_T (v)$ with: $\text{up}_T(v)=\min_{w \in W,\ u \in U}(\text{up}_T(w),u.\text{depth})$, where $W$ is the set of all children of $v$ and $U$ is the set of all neighbors of $v$.
   
   3. Also calculate $s(v,G)$ with the method in (3) if $v \ne r$.

2. For $r$, $s(r,G) = \text{deg}(r)$ in DFS tree.

### Time Complexity

- Initialization for DFS takes $O(|V|)$ time.

- For each vertex $v$:
  
  - Visiting every neighbor vertices $v$ takes $O(|E_v|)$ time. $E_v$ is the set of edges with $v$ at one end.
  
  - Calculating $s(v,G)$ and $\text{up}_T(v)$ takes $O(|E_v|)$ time.

- And calculating $s(r,G)$ takes $O(|E_r|)$ time (checking all neighboring vertices' predecessor).

- Total time complexity is $O(|V|) + \Sigma_{v \in V}\ O(|E_v|)=O(|V|) + O(2\cdot|E|)=O(|V|+|E|)$

### Correctness

$\text{up}_T(v)$ can be calculated by:

$$
\text{up}_T(v)=\min_{w \in W,\ u \in U}(\text{up}_T(w),u.\text{depth})
$$

where $W$ is the set of all children of $v$ and $U$ is the set of all neighbors of $v$. Because $\min_{w \in W}\text{up}_T(w)$ includes all neighbors of "descendants of $v$ excluding $v$", only neighbors of $v$ haven't been considered.

$s(w,G)$ and $\text{up}_T(w)$ are calculated after visiting $w$. $u.\text{depth}$ is also calculated after visiting all children because $u$ must be either $v$'s ancestor or descendant (no cross edge in undirected graph). Therefore, all needed values for $s(v, G)$ and $\text{up}_T(v, G)$ are available during calculation.

For root $r$, because there are no cross edges, $s(r,G)$ is number of sub-trees, which is also $\deg(r)$.
